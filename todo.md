# TODO 

- [ ] download fontawesome svgs (deferred 500kb)

## Learning Posts Page

- [x] add learning logs to home page
- [ ] see how multiple learning log look
- add nav bar?

### Maybe TODO 
- make section pages for sections without frontmatter content 404
    - not sure if this is the right approach.
    - maybe there is a frontmatter tag to use that disables a section from being rendered by going to `<section>/`
- Add block cursor to tag line
- Hugo seems to be building more assets into the public dir than it needs to.
  - for example, cirtical.pcss doesn't need to be there.
  - Move non-built resources to the assets dir so they arent built
    - look for **assets** https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/
- Rollback corner of project thumbnail on hover
- make learning logs animate in
